TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
We learned how to pip install anaconda, tensorflow and several other extentions so that we could run a script
that would detect when a person was raising their hand by using a webcam.
My partner and I worked together to create the script which would print "Someone is hailing the taxi" when
it detected someone raising their hand.
So far nothing taught is unclear up to this point.
