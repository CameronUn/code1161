TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learned more about matplotlib and pandas. I've also got a small plan on how i am going to present my findings and i've got a question to answer with a dataset online. So far i've encountered small problems but nothing i couldn't fix. Everything taught was clear up to this point.
