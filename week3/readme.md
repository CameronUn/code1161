TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
We didn't learn anything new, just went over week 2's excerises. I couldn't seem to get any of the questions
correct in week3. I tried looking online but i couldn't put it all together.

EDIT: After spending an all nighter, ive managed to solve the first question which led to me completing several other questions. I believe we are being thrown into the deep end too quickly.
